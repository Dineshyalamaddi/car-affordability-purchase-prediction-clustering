# Car Affordability & Purchase Prediction with Customer Segmentation 🚗📊
A data science project that predicts car purchase behavior, scores affordability using financial features, and segments customers using clustering.
This project predicts car purchase decisions and affordability using a consumer dataset and applies clustering for customer segmentation.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Predict car purchase likelihood.
- Score and categorize customers based on affordability.
- Segment customers using KMeans clustering.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📁 Dataset
- Columns: `customer name`, `age`, `annual salary`, `credit card debt`, `net worth`, `car purchase amount`
- Classification target: `buyer` (0 or 1)
- Used for clustering: Financial features

## 📊 Highlights
- EDA with visualizations (pair plots, heatmaps)
- Affordability scoring and customer segmentation
- Classification models: Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- KMeans clustering

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
